      <td id="ver_check">Check if WordPress core is up to date.</td>
      <td><p>Keeping the WordPress core up to date is one of the most important aspects of keeping your site secure. If vulnerabilities are discovered in WordPress and a new version is released to address the issue, the information required to exploit the vulnerability is almost certainly in the public domain. This makes old versions more open to attacks, and is one of the primary reasons you should always keep WordPress up to date.</p>
      <p>Thanks to automatic updates updating is very easy. Just go to <a href="update-core.php">Dashboard - Updates</a> and click "Upgrade". <b>Remember</b> - always backup your files and database before upgrading!</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td id="plugins_ver_check">Check if plugins are up to date.</td>
      <td><p>As with the WordPress core, keeping plugins up to date is one of the most important and easier way to keep your site secure. Since most plugins are free and therefore their code is available to anyone having the latest version will ensure you're not prone to attacks based on known vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p>If you downloaded a plugin from the official WP repository you can easily check if there are any upgrades available, and upgrade it by opening <a href="update-core.php">Dashboard - Updates</a>. If you bought the plugin from CodeCanyon be sure to check the item's page and upgrade manually. <b>Remember</b> - always backup your files and database before upgrading!</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td id="themes_ver_check">Check if themes are up to date.</td>
      <td><p>As with the WordPress core, keeping the themes up to date is one of the most important and easier way to keep your site secure. Since most themes are free and therefore their code is available to anyone having the latest version will ensure you're not prone to attacks based on known vulnerabilities. Also, having the latest version will ensure your theme is compatible with the latest version of WP.</p>
      <p>If you downloaded a theme from the official WP repository you can easily check if there are any upgrades available, and upgrade it by opening <a href="themes.php">Appearance - Themes</a>. If you bought the theme from ThemeForest be sure to check the theme's page and upgrade manually. <b>Remember</b> - always backup your files and database before upgrading!</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td id="wp_header_meta">Check if full WP version info is revealed in page's meta data.</td>
      <td><p>You should be proud that your site is powered by WordPress and there's no need to hide that information. However disclosing the full WP version info in the default location (page header meta) is not wise. People with bad intentions can easily use Google to find site's that use a specific version of WordPress and target them with 0-day exploits.</p>
      <p>Place the following code in your theme's <i>functions.php</i> file in order to remove the header meta version info:</p>
      <pre>function remove_version() {
  return '';
}
add_filter('the_generator', 'remove_version');</pre>

    <tr>
    <td id="readme_check">Check if WordPress <i>readme.html</i> file is accessible via HTTP on the default location.</td>
      <td><p>As mentioned in the previous test - you should be proud that your site is powered by WordPress but also hide the exact version you're using. <i>readme.html</i> contains WP version info and if left on the default location (WP root) attackers can easily find out your WP version.</p>
      <p>This is a very easy problem to solve. Rename the file to something more unique like "readme-876.html"; delete it; move it to another location or chmod it so that it's not accessible via HTTP.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td id="php_headers">Check if server response headers contain detailed PHP version info.</td>
      <td><p>As with the WordPress version it's not wise to disclose the exact PHP version you're using because it makes the job of attacking your site much easier. This issue is not directly WP related but it definitely affects your site.</p>
      <p>You'll most probably have to ask your hosting company to configure the HTTP server not to show PHP version info but you can also try adding these directives to the <i>.htacces</i> file: </p>
      <pre>&lt;IfModule mod_headers.c&gt;
  Header unset X-Powered-By
  Header unset Server
&lt;/IfModule&gt;</pre>

    <tr>
    <td id="user_exists">Check if user with username "admin" exists.</td>
      <td><p>If someone tries to guess your username and password or tries a brute-force attack they'll most probably start with username "admin". This is the default username used by too many sites and should be removed.</p>
      <p><a href="user-new.php">Create a new user</a> and assign him the "administrator" role. Try not to use usernames like: "root", "god", "null" or similar ones. Once you have the new user created delete the "admin" one and assign all post/pages he may have created to the new user.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td id="check_failed_login_info">Check for display of unnecessary information on failed login attempts.</td>
      <td><p>By default on failed login attempts WordPress will tell you whether username or password is wrong. An attacker can use that to find out which usernames are active on your system and then use brute-force methods to hack the password.</p>
      <p>Solution to this problem is simple. Whether user enters wrong username or wrong password we always tell him "wrong username or password" so that he doesn't know which of two is wrong. Open your theme's <i>functions.php</i> file and copy/paste the following code:</p>
      <pre>function wrong_login() {
  return 'Wrong username or password.';
}
add_filter('login_errors', 'wrong_login');</pre>

    <td id="salt_keys_check">Check if all security keys and salts have proper values.</td>
      <td><p>Security keys are used to ensure better encryption of information stored in the user's cookies and hashed passwords. You don't have to remember these keys. In fact once you set them you'll never see them again. Therefore there's no excuse for not setting them properly.</p>
      <p>Security keys (there are eight) are defined in <i>wp-config.php</i> as constants on lines #45-52. They should be as unique and as long as possible. WordPress made a <a href="https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/">great script</a> which helps you generate those strings. Please use it! After the script generates strings those 8 lines of code should look something like this:</p>
      <pre>define('AUTH_KEY',         '}D4@p&lt;0VFKb*pdhM8c&lt;bb:qB%Fr8:- dc}U(,[K?hobrzsn*:r?,e^/eHsm6nHls');

    <td id="db_password_check">Test the strength of WordPress database password.</td>
      <td><p>There is no such thing as an "unimportant password"! The same goes for WordPress database password. Although most servers are configured so that the database can't be accessed from other hosts that doesn't mean your database passsword should be "12345". Choose a proper password, at least 8 characters long with a combination of letters, numbers and special characters.</p>

      <p>To change the database password open cPanel, Plesk or some other hosting control panel you have. Find the option to change the database password and be sure you make the new password strong enough. If you can't find that option or you're uncomfortable changing it contact your hosting provider. After the password is changed open wp<i>-config.php</i> and change the password on line #25:</p>
      <pre>/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'YOUR_NEW_DB_PASSWORD_GOES_HERE');</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td id="db_table_prefix_check">Check if database table prefix is the default one (<i>wp_</i>).</td>
      <td><p>Knowing the names of your database tables can help an attacker dump the table's data and get to sensitive information like password hashes. Since WP table names are predefined the only way you can change table names is by using a unique prefix. One that's different from "wp_" or any similar variation such as "wordpress_".</p>
      <p>If you're doing a fresh installation defining a unique table prefix is easy. Open <i>wp-config.php</i> and go to line #61 where the table prefix is defined. Enter something unique like "frog99_" and install WP.</p>
      <p>If you already have WP site running and want to change the table prefix things are a bit more complicated and you should only do the change if you're comfortable doing some changes to your DB data via phpMyAdmin or a similar GUI. Detailed 6-step instruction can be found on <a href="http://tdot-blog.com/wordpress/6-simple-steps-to-change-your-table-prefix-in-wordpress">Tdot blog</a>. <b>Remember</b> - always backup your files and database before making any changes to the database!</p>

Not only will it slow down your site, confuse your visitors with weird messages it will also give the potential attacker valuable information about your system.</p>
      <p>General WordPress debugging mode is enabled/disabled by a constant defined in <i>wp-config.php</i>. Open that file and look for a line similar to:</p>
      <pre>define('WP_DEBUG', true);</pre>
      <p>Comment it out, delete it or replace with the following to disable debugging:</p>
      <pre>define('WP_DEBUG', false);</pre>

      <td><p>Moving WP core files to any non-standard folder will make your site less vulnerable to automated attacks. Most scripts that script kiddies use rely on default file paths. If your blog is setup on <i>www.site.com</i> you can put WP files in ie: <i>/var/www/vhosts/site.com/www/wp-core/</i> instead of the obvious <i>/var/www/vhosts/site.com/www/</i>.</p>
      <p>Site and WP address can easily be changed in <a href="options-general.php">Options - General</a>.

      <p>What's the best chmod for your <i>wp-config.php</i> depends on the way your server is configured but there are some general guidelines you can follow. If you're hosting on a Windows based server ignore all of the following.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>try setting chmod to 0400 or 0440 and if the site works normally that's the best one to use</li>
      <li>"other" users should have no privileges on the file so set the last octal digit to zero</li>
