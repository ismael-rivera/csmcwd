UPGRADE NOTES////
--------------------------------------------------------------
DUKAPRESS

FILES I ALTERED AND MODIFIED FROM DUKAPRESS THAT MUST BE KEPT WHEN UPGRADING OR AT LEAST REVIEWED IN ORDER TO MANTAIN APPLICATION WORKING AS IS.

dukapress/css/dpsc-basic.css
dukapress/php/dp-products.php

SO PLEASE BACK THESE FILES UP WHEN UPGRADING TO A NEWER VERSION OF ANY MODIFIED PLUGINS. JUST TO BE CERTAIN YOU SHOULD BACK UP THE ENTIRE PLUGIN FOLDER TO ENSURE A PROPER TRANSITION. THAT WAY, IN THE EVENT OF ANY PROBLEMS YOU WILL STILL HAVE THE WORKING STABLE VERSION ON BACKUP.

THANK YOU ?-0
